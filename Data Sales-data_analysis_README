Cannabis Retail Sales Analysis Program
Overview

The Cannabis Retail Sales Analysis Program is a Python script designed to analyze and visualize retail sales data in the cannabis industry. It utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.
Purpose

The purpose of this program is to provide insights into the distribution of adult-use and medical marijuana retail sales over a specific time period. By analyzing sales data, stakeholders in the cannabis industry can better understand consumer trends, market dynamics, and the overall performance of retail sales channels.
Functionality

The program performs the following tasks:

    Data Loading: It loads sales data from a CSV file named "Cannabis_Retail_Sales_by_Week_Ending.csv".

    Data Analysis: It generates histograms to visualize the distribution of adult-use retail sales and medical marijuana retail sales separately.

    Visualization: It uses Matplotlib to create histograms that display the frequency distribution of sales amounts for both adult-use and medical marijuana products.

Usage

To use the program:

    Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

    Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries (Pandas and Matplotlib). You can install them using pip:

    bash

pip install pandas matplotlib

Place the CSV file containing the sales data in the same directory as the Python script.

Run the Python script sales_analysis.py:

bash

python sales_analysis.py

The program will generate histograms displaying the distribution of adult-use and medical marijuana retail sales, providing insights into sales trends.
